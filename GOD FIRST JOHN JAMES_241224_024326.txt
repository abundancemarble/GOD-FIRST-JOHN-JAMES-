<!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE -->

{{tl|Infobox person}} may be used to summarize information about a particular person, usually at the top of an article.

== Redirects and calls ==
At least {{PAGESINCATEGORY:Templates calling Infobox person}} other [[:Category:Templates calling Infobox person|templates call this one]] and many templates [{{fullurl:Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Infobox_person|namespace=10&hidetrans=1&hidelinks=1}} redirect here].

== Modules ==
The following templates are suitable for use as a "module" in this one:
* Templates in [[:Category:Biographical templates usable as a module]]
* {{tl|Listen}}
* {{tl|Infobox Chinese}}

== Usage ==
The infobox may be added by pasting the template as shown below into an article and then filling in the desired fields. Any parameters left blank or omitted will not be displayed.

== Parameters ==
{{large|Do not use all these parameters for any one person. The list is long to cover a wide range of people. Only use those parameters that convey essential or notable information about the subject, and ensure that this information is sourced in the article or (if present only in the infobox) in the infobox itself}}

Any parameters left blank or omitted will not be displayed. Many parameters have alternative names, implemented for compatibility with other templates (especially to aid merging). The preferred names are shown in the table below.

{| class="wikitable"
! Parameter
! Explanation
|-
| {{mono|honorific_prefix}}
| To appear on the line above the person's name. This is for honorifics of serious significance that are attached to the name in formal address, such as knighthoods, "The Honourable", and "His/Her Excellency"; do not use it for routine things like "{{!mxt|[[Dr.]]}}" or "{{!mxt|[[Ms.]]}}"
|-
| {{mono|name}}
| Common name of person (defaults to article name if left blank; provide {{para|birth_name}} (below) if different from {{para|name}}). If middle initials are specified (or implied) by the lead of the article, and are not specified separately in the {{para|birth_name}} parameter, include them here. ''Do not put honorifics or alternative names in this parameter.'' There are separate parameters for these things, covered below.
|-
| {{mono|honorific_suffix}}
| To appear on the line below the person's name. This is for things like {{para|honorific_suffix|[[Officer of the Order of the British Empire|OBE]]}} – honorifics of serious significance that are attached to the name in formal address, such as national orders and non-honorary doctorates; do not use it for routine things like "{{!mxt|[[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]}}". It is permissible but not required to use the {{tlx|post-nominals}} template inside this parameter; doing so requires {{tlx|post-nominals|size{{=}}100%|...}}.
|-
| {{mono|image}}
| Image name: {{pval|abc.jpg}}, {{pval|xpz.png}}, {{pval|123.gif}}, etc., without the {{code|File:}} or {{code|Image:}} prefix. If an image is desired but not available, one may add {{pval|yes}} to the {{para|needs-photo}} parameter of the {{tlx|WikiProject Biography}} template on the talk page. If no image is available yet, [[Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Image placeholders|do not use an image placeholder]]. See [[#Image]] for further guidelines.
|-
| {{mono|image_upright}}
| Scales the image thumbnail from its default size by the given factor. Values less than 1 scale the image down (0.9 = 90%) and values greater than 1 scale the image up (1.15 = 115%).
|-
| {{mono|landscape}}
| Set to <code>yes</code> when using wide, short images. The image height (rather than width) will be limited to 200 pixels. 
|-
| {{mono|alt}}
| Descriptive [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility/Alternative text for images|{{code|alt}} text for the image]], for visually impaired readers. One word (such as {{pval|photograph}}) is rarely sufficient. Do not copy-paste the value of {{para|caption}} (below) into this parameter. Example of the difference: "Willie Nelson at a concert in Dallas, 1989" is good as {{para|caption}} value; "Nelson in western-wear with an acoustic guitar, on stage in a daytime show with band in background" is an {{para|alt}} description. If nothing meaningful can be said that isn't already in the caption, use the [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility/Alternative text for images#Captions and nearby text|stock text]] {{para|alt|refer to caption}}.
|-
| {{mono|caption}}
| Caption for image, if needed. Try to include the date of photo, some context (check the <code>File:</code> or [[Wikimedia Commons|Commons]] page for the image). Image credit should generally not be included per [[MOS:CREDITS]].
|-
| {{mono|native_name}}
| The person's name in their own language, if different.
|-
| {{mono|native_name_lang}}
| [[ISO 639-1]] code, e.g., "{{pval|fr}}" for French. If more than one, use {{tlx|lang}} around each name in {{para|native_name}} instead.
|-
| {{mono|pronunciation}}
| Details of how to pronounce the individual's native name. <!--copied from TemplateData description, if changed please update there also-->
|-
| {{mono|birth_name}}
| Name at birth; only use if different from {{para|name}}.
|-
| {{mono|birth_date}}
| Date of birth: Use {{tlx|birth date and age}} (if living) or {{tlx|birth date}} (if dead). {{crossref|See template's page for details on usage.}} If only a year of birth is known, or age as of a certain date, consider using {{tlx|birth year and age}} or {{tlx|birth based on age as of date}}. For living people [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons#Privacy of personal information and using primary sources|supply only the year unless the exact date is already widely published]]. Treat such cases as if only the year is known, so use {{tlx|birth year and age}} or a similar option. The templates mentioned in this paragraph emit metadata indicating the date is in the Gregorian calendar; if the date is in the Julian calendar, do not use these templates, just write the date.
|-
| {{mono|{{vanchor|birth_place}}}}
| Place of birth: {{var|city}}, {{var|administrative region}}, {{var|country}}.
* Use the name of the birthplace at the time of birth, e.g.: {{pval|Saigon}} (prior to 1976) or {{pval|Ho Chi Minh City}} (post-1976).
* [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Icons#Do not use flags to indicate locations of birth, residence, or death|Do not use a flag template]], coat of arms, or other icon.
* [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Infoboxes#Purpose|Omit unnecessary or redundant details]]. For example, it is not necessary to state: {{!xt|{{pval|New York City, [[New York (state)|New York]], United States}}}} when {{xt|{{pval|New York City, U.S.}}}} conveys essentially the same information more concisely.
* Country name should be visible (not just in a link target). Well-known countries [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Linking#What generally should not be linked|should generally not be linked]], but historical and less-well-known countries can be.
* For modern subjects, the country should generally be a sovereign state; for United Kingdom locations, the constituent [[Countries of the United Kingdom|countries of the UK]] are sometimes used instead, when more appropriate in the context.
* For historical subjects, use the place name most appropriate for the context and our readership. What the place may correspond to on a modern map is a matter for an article's main text.
* For subsequent places (of death, etc.) it is not necessary to repeat jurisdictional details or links for the same place name.
* Follow [[MOS:USA]], e.g. "US" instead of "USA"
|-
| {{mono|baptised}}
| Date of baptism: {{em|Only}} for use when birth date is not known (e.g., for [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]). Will not display if a birth date is entered. Do not use subtemplates. Parameter <code>baptized</code> can be used for articles that use American English spelling.
|-
| {{mono|disappeared_date}}
| (For missing people) Date of disappearance: Use {{tlx|disappeared date and age}} (if birth date is known) or {{tlx|disappeared date}} (if birth date unknown).
|-
| {{mono|disappeared_place}}
| (For missing people) Place of disappearance: {{var|city}}, {{var|administrative region}}, {{var|country}}.&nbsp;<!--This space is needed for readability, due to quirk of these templated elements being in proximity.--> ({{crossref|See {{para|birth_place}}, [[#birth place|above]], for instructions on how to use this parameter}}, including: no flag templates, inappropriate linking, redundancy, anachronisms, "country" definitions, etc.)
|-
| {{mono|disappeared_status}}
| (For missing people) Current status for the person, e.g., if the person is still regarded as missing (using {{tlx|missing for}} to calculate the time since disappearance), or if the person has been [[Declared death in absentia|declared dead ''{{lang|la|in absentia}}'']], with a date for such a ruling.
|-
| {{mono|death_date}}
| Date of death: Use {{tlx|death date and age}} (if birth date is known) or {{tlx|death date}} (if birth date unknown). {{crossref|See template's page for details on usage.}} If exact dates are unknown, consider using {{tlx|death year and age}}. The templates mentioned in this paragraph emit metadata indicating the date is in the Gregorian calendar; if the date is in the Julian calendar, do not use these templates, just write the date.
|-
| {{mono|death_place}}
| Place of death: {{var|city}}, {{var|administrative region}}, {{var|country}}.&nbsp; ({{crossref|See {{para|birth_place}}, [[#birth place|above]], for instructions on how to use this parameter}}, including: no flag templates, inappropriate linking, redundancy, anachronisms, "country" definitions, etc.)
|-
| {{mono|death_cause}}
| Cause of death. Should be clearly defined and sourced, and should only be included when the cause of death has significance for the subject's notability, e.g. [[James Dean]], [[John Lennon]]. It should not be filled in for unremarkable deaths such as those from old age or routine illness, e.g. [[Bruce Forsyth]], [[Eduard Khil]].
|-
| {{mono|body_discovered}}
| Place where the body was discovered (if different from place of death). {{var|city}}, {{var|administrative region}}, {{var|country}}.&nbsp; ({{crossref|See {{para|birth_place}}, [[#birth place|above]], for instructions on how to use this parameter}}, including: no flag templates, inappropriate linking, redundancy, anachronisms, "country" definitions, etc.)
|-
| {{mono|burial_place}}
| Place of burial {{var|city}}, {{var|administrative region}}, {{var|country}}.&nbsp; ({{crossref|See {{para|birth_place}}, [[#birth place|above]], for instructions on how to use this parameter}}, including: no flag templates, inappropriate linking, redundancy, anachronisms, "country" definitions, etc. {{crossref|See {{para|resting_place}} for non-burials}}.)
|-
| {{mono|burial_coordinates}}
| Coordinates for place of burial, to accompany {{para|burial_place}}. Use {{tlx|coord}} template.
|-
| {{mono|resting_place}}
| Location of columbarium, ash-scattering, etc. If no location, leave blank. {{var|city}}, {{var|administrative region}}, {{var|country}}.&nbsp; ({{crossref|See {{para|birth_place}}, [[#birth place|above]], for instructions on how to use this parameter}}, including: no flag templates, inappropriate linking, redundancy, anachronisms, "country" definitions, etc.)
|-
| {{mono|resting_place_coordinates}}
| Coordinates for location of columbarium, ash-scattering etc. Use {{tlx|coord}} template.
|-
| {{mono|monuments}}
| Significant monuments erected, buildings named, etc., in honour of the subject. If many, link to an appropriate section of the article instead.
|-
| {{mono|nationality}}
| {{anchor|nationality}} Per [[WP:INFONAT]], should not be used because it was designated for legal [[nationality]] but was often confused with ethnicity (which is not allowed in infoboxes).
|-
| {{mono|other_names}}
| Other notable names for the person, if different from {{para|name}} and {{para|birth_name}}. [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Biographies#Pseudonyms|This can include]] stage names, maiden/married names, nicknames, criminal aliases, etc.
|-
| {{mono|siglum}}
| [[Siglum]] or monogram, a text shortcut (often formed from the initials of the name, with variations) used to sign work, if relevant.
|-
| {{mono|citizenship}}
| Country of legal citizenship or nationality. Rarely needed - omit if the same as birth country. See [[WP:INFONAT]] for detailed guidelines. {{crossref|Also see {{para|birth_place}}, [[#birth place|above]], for instructions on how to use this parameter}}, including: no flag templates, inappropriate linking, anachronisms, "country" definitions, etc.
|-
| {{mono|education}}
| Education, e.g., degree, institution and graduation year, if relevant. If very little information is available or relevant, the {{para|alma_mater}} parameter may be more appropriate.
|-
| {{mono|alma_mater}}
| ''[[Alma mater]]''. This parameter is a more concise alternative to (not addition to) {{para|education}}, and will often consist of the linked name of the last-attended institution of higher education (not secondary schools). It is usually not relevant to include either parameter for non-graduates, but article talk page consensus may conclude otherwise, as perhaps at [[Bill Gates]].
|-
| {{mono|occupation}}
| Occupation(s) as given in the lead. Use list markup for three or more entries, e.g. with {{tlx|flatlist}}. Please observe [[sentence case]] and capitalise only the first letter of the first item; e.g.:
{{block indent|1={{Flatlist|
* Musician
* singer-songwriter
* actor
}}}}
|-
| {{mono|years_active}}
| Date range in years during which the subject was active in their principal occupation(s) and/or other activity for which they are notable. Use the format {{code|1950–2000}}, or {{code|1970–present}} if still active. [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers#Ranges|Date ranges]] always use an [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style#En dashes|en dash]], not hyphen. If no dates of birth and/or death are known for the subject, only a ''[[floruit]]'' date range, as is common with ancient subjects, this parameter can be used for it. If approximate (''[[wikt:circa#English|circa]]'') dates are known for either or both, put them in the {{para|birth_date}} and {{para|death_date}} parameters. Helpful templates: {{tlx|floruit}}, {{tlx|circa}}.

* The {{para|notable_works}}, {{para|credits}}, and {{para|label_name}} parameters are intended to be (at most) short [[#Inline lists|inline lists]].
* The {{para|label_name}} variant is used for one or more record labels with which a performer is associated, or a fashion label in which a designer has been heavily involved or for which they are well known. Remember that this parameter is an alternative to the others mentioned here and is not used along with them.
* The {{para|works}} variant is intended to link to {{em|a specific list article}} for a larger body of work (not all of which may be individually notable).

|-
| {{mono|callsign}}
| Amateur radio [[call sign]], if relevant.
|-
| {{mono|awards}}
| Notable awards. If many, link to an appropriate section of the article instead. Use {{para|title}} parameter, above, for awarded titles; A single award should not use both parameters.
|-
| {{mono|website}}
| Official website only. Unofficial websites should be placed under <code><nowiki>==External links==</nowiki></code> in the body of the article. Use {{tlx|URL}} as in {{tnull|URL|Example.com}}. Do not display the {{samp|www.}} part unless the site requires it.
|-

|-
| {{mono|signature_type}}
| Changes the '''Signature''' label to the preferred argument, such as '''Seal'''

| Default is {{samp|150px}}. If necessary, a signature can be resized manually as per the {{para|image_size}} parameter.
|-
| {{mono|signature_alt}}
| Alt text for the signature image. For example, for {{samp|[[:File:Thomas Jefferson Signature.svg]]}}, the alt text might be {{para|signature_alt| Th: Jefferson}}, spelling out the signature exactly as it appears in the image.
|-
| {{mono|footnotes}}
| Textual notes about any of the infobox data. This is not for reference citations. If an infobox parameter's value needs a citation, [[Wikipedia:Citing sources|cite inline]] at the end of the value. Citations will appear in the article's references section along with the other citations in the article.
|-
| {{mono|image_size}}
| {{strongbad|Deprecated}}. Size to display image: {{pval|200px}} (set width), {{pval|x300px}} (set height), or {{pval|200x300px}} (max width & max height). If empty or omitted, this defaults to {{samp|frameless}} (default is {{samp|220px}}, but logged-in users can change this by clicking on "my preferences" and adjusting thumbnail size). [[Wikipedia:Image use policy#Displayed image size|Use of this parameter is discouraged]]. Use image_upright instead. Do not use "{{!mxt|×}}" or capital "{{!mxt|X}}"
|}

=== Additional parameter usage explanation ===
==== Image ====
The image in the infobox should be representative of the person who is the subject of the article. For some historical figures, particularly those born in the 18th century or before, this image is often a painting or other artistic depiction of the individual (see [[George Washington]]). Persons born in the 20th century onward, such as [[Barack Obama]], are most often represented by a photograph of the individual.

When the subject of a biographical article has recently died, particularly those who have been publicly known for decades, editors may come to a consensus on the article's talk page regarding what image would best be suited for the infobox. An example of such a discussion can be found in the talk page archives for [[Elizabeth II]] (section [[Talk:Elizabeth II/Archive 45#Infobox photograph for after her death|Infobox photograph for after her death]]); in this instance, the 2015 photograph of Elizabeth II that was present in the article's infobox when discussions began was eventually replaced with a photograph of her taken in 1958.

=== Inline lists ===
{{Main|WP:Manual of Style/Lists#Horizontal lists|WP:Manual of Style/Lists#Unbulleted lists}}
Parameters with multiple values should be formatted with inline-list templates.

'''Horizontal''' ones include {{tlx|hlist}} or {{tlx|flatlist}}. In [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lists#Horizontal lists|horizontal style]], only the first item is capitalized (aside from [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Proper names|proper names]]).
This style is best for short items, and few of them. Mid-dots, commas or semicolons are available as separators (use semicolons or mid-dots if any items contain their own commas). For example:
* {{para|parameter_name|{{tlp|hlist |Foo |bar |baz}}}} → {{hlist |Foo |bar |baz}}
* {{para|parameter_name|{{tlp|cslist |Foo |bar |baz}}}} → {{cslist |Foo |bar |baz}}
* {{para|parameter_name|{{tlp|cslist |Foo, fee |bar, bor |baz, biz |semi=true}}}} → {{cslist |Foo, fee |bar, bor |baz, biz |semi=true}}

Horizontal list example with {{tlx|hlist|Item one|item two|item three}}: {{hlist|Item one|item two|item three}}

'''Vertical''' templates are {{tlx|plainlist}} and {{tlx|unbulleted list}} (vertical), use [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lists#Unbulleted lists|unbulleted, non-indented lists]] for clean display in infoboxes. Entries may be all [[sentence case]], or all lowercase (aside from proper names) after the first.

This style is best for long items, and longer lists. For long lists of information that may not be of immediate interest but retained for reference, the {{tlx|collapsible list}} template can be used; this is not a universally accessible option, so should not be used for key information.

''[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lists#Line breaks|Do not use {{tag|br|s}} markup]]'' to create fake lists, as in: {{!mxt|<nowiki>Item one<br />item two<br />item three</nowiki>}}.

Vertical list example:, using {{tlx|unbulleted list|Item one|item two|item three}}:
{{unbulleted list|Item one|item two|item three}}
