God Hears Me

 TODAY’S VERSE
“But in my distress I cried out to the LORD; yes, I prayed to my God for help. He heard me from his sanctuary; my cry to him reached his ears. Psalms 18:6 (NLT)

TODAY’S THOUGHT
I love hope. I need hope. Everyday is new and so are the challenges. And there are a lot of things we can do to help ourself get through the morass of issues and concerns that face us. There are a lot of different techniques and systems that will help us. New ways of thinking, new tools. But one thing surpasses every coping mechanism, every strategy, every method of problem solving. It is our relationship with God. David knew this. He was a doer. He knew how to solve problems, yet when he was in severe crises, there was one place he went to over and over again. He went to God. He went to the arms of his good shepherd. And God heard him. He writes, “Yes, I prayed to my God for help. He heard me from his sanctuary; my cry to him reached his ears.” His cries reached the ears of Heaven. So will yours. Today, don’t stop whatever is helping you but add to it the one thing that can make all the difference. In all your striving add hope. Cry out to the Lord, you will reach His ears. 

TODAY’S PRAYER
Dear Father, I come to You. I come and present all my needs, all my concerns. I cannot make it without You. I cry out and I know You hear me. Comfort me even today, Lord. In Jesus’ name.
AMEN

TODAY’S AFFIRMATION & MEDITATION
God hears my prayers
Close your eyes and picture yourself before God, hands stretched out, humbly sharing your needs and concerns. Picture God looking at you with joy and understanding. Sense His concern and love for you. Breathe deep and as you exhale say, “Thank you, God, for hearing me.”


TODAY’S VERSE
“Come close to God, and God will come close to you.” James 4:8 (NLT)

TODAY’S THOUGHT
A person shared that there was a sign on the expressway that said, “Do you feel far away from God?” He was thinking about the question when the next billboard read, “Who moved?” Isn’t that usually the case? When we feel far from God, it is because we have turned our back on Him. James knew that we have this propensity so he wrote, “Come close to God, and God will come close to you.” But the question is, how do we come close to God? The first thing we need to do is turn back in the right direction. The Prophet Isaiah wrote, “It’s your sins that have cut you off from God. Because of your sins, he has turned away and will not listen anymore.” Confessing to God and repenting from any sin, will allow us to have a clear conscience and reopen the door of fellowship Him. Then we can turn to God with our heart and mind. Both our emotions and thoughts have so much to do with our relationship with Him. We come to Him in quietness, reflection, meditation and prayer. We open our emotions and thoughts to Him and allow His Holy Spirit to commune with us, guiding, convicting, teaching and directing our life. God desires to have a relationship with us. He hasn’t moved. Will you come to Him today?

TODAY’S PRAYER
Father, I must confess that there are so many times I feel so distant from You. I admit my own wandering. Forgive me for the sin that has separated us and help me to stay in close fellowship with you. I give you my heart and my mind. Lead me by Your Holy Spirit, I pray.
AMEN

TODAY’S AFFIRMATION & MEDITATION
I have fellowship with God
Stop and allow God to speak to you about anything that would be in the way of fellowship with Him. As He brings anything to mind, confess it and ask for forgiveness. Allow God to forgive and cleanse you. As you do, picture yourself moving toward God and He being there, waiting and very happy to be with you. Take a deep breathe and then say, “I have fellowship with God.”

TODAY’S VERSE
“Give us, your servants, great boldness in preaching your word. Stretch out your hand with healing power; may miraculous signs and wonders be done through the name of your holy servant Jesus.’ After this prayer, the meeting place shook, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit. Then they preached the word of God with boldness. All the believers were united in heart and mind. And they felt that what they owned was not their own, so they shared everything they had. The apostles testified powerfully to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and God’s great blessing was upon them all. There were no needy people among them, because those who owned land or houses would sell them and bring the money to the apostles to give to those in need.” Acts 4:29-35 (NLT)
TODAY’S THOUGHT
Is there any wonder why the Church grew so mightily in the first century? Men and women who had known Jesus Christ, who had experienced mighty miracles and had seen Jesus rise from the dead, were now filled with the Holy Spirit. They were on a mission to share the glorious THOUGHT of God’s forgiveness and grace to everyone they could. How does today’s passage compare to your church or personal Christian experience? Erwin McManus in his book, “The Barbarian Way,” writes, “Somehow Christianity has become a non-mystical religion. It is about reasonable faith. If we believe the right things, we are orthodox. Frankly, whether we ever actually connect to God or experience His undeniable presence has become incidental if not irrelevant.” Sadly, what McManus is saying is true. Today let us repent of our “reasonable faith” and join those in Acts asking God to fill us with His Spirit and give us boldness in sharing about Christ. Let us ask God for His healing power and miraculous signs and wonders. Finally, let us share with those in need, be united in our hearts and mind and testify powerfully of the resurrection of our Lord Jesus. May it be said of us that “God’s great blessing was upon them all.”

TODAY’S PRAYER
Father, forgive us for powerless orthodoxy. Forgive us for our lack of faith and sacrifice. We pray for a holy boldness in our church. We pray for Your miraculous hand to come upon us and do mighty works. We pray for unity of hearts and mind. Might the places we worship be shaken. In Jesus’ Name.
AMEN

TODAY’S AFFIRMATION & MEDITATION
I am a disciple of Jesus Christ
Today stop and meditate with a conviction in your heart. You have committed yourself to follow Christ with passion so now spend time visualizing what that means. Picture yourself living for Him. Sense His power alive in your life. Picture mighty things happening because of your faith and expectancy. Finish by asking God to make you visions come true. Go and live as a Disciple of Christ.

TODAY’S VERSE
“Let the morning bring me word of your unfailing love, for I have put my trust in you. Show me the way I should go, for to you I lift up my soul. Rescue me from my enemies, O LORD, for I hide myself in you. Teach me to do your will, for you are my God; may your good Spirit lead me on level ground.” Psalms 143:8, 10 (NIV)

TODAY’S MESSAGE
Do you start your day hearing a word from God about His unfailing love? Do you start your day trusting in Him? Do you ask Him for direction, protection and instruction for the tasks that are ahead of you this day? If not, what is stopping you now? No matter what your yesterdays were, no matter what you fear for tomorrow, there is nothing stopping you from committing this day to God. You can begin a new habit of thanksgiving and expectation today.

TODAY’S PRAYER
Father, in the quietness of this moment, let me hear You confirm Your unfailing love for me. Right now, I put my complete trust in You. Please, dear God, show me the way I should go, for I lift up my soul to You. Rescue me from any trouble today, O LORD, for I hide myself in You. Teach me to do Your will, for You are my God; may Your Holy Spirit lead me today. In Jesus’ name.
AMEN

TODAY’S AFFIRMATION & MEDITATION
I will live this day for God
Today’s passage is a great visualization. Read it again and see everything it says happening to you. “Let the morning bring me word of your unfailing love, for I have put my trust in you. Show me the way I should go, for to you I lift up my soul. Rescue me from my enemies, O LORD, for I hide myself in you. Teach me to do your will, for you are my God; may your good Spirit lead me on level ground.”


I cry out to the LORD; I plead for the LORD’s mercy. I pour out my complaints before him and tell him all my troubles. When I am overwhelmed, you alone know the way I should turn.” Psalms 142:1-3 (NLT)

TODAY’S THOUGHT
Have you ever felt overwhelmed? I talk to people everyday that feel that way. Divorce, hunger, disease, addictions, homelessness, debt, trauma, everyday people come to our church for help. And it should be that way. The church is God’s representative on earth. We should be telling everyone that God deeply cares about their personal affairs. David knew this. He was overwhelmed with life and all the challenges it had for him, yet he knew he could turn to the Lord. He cried out to God and plead for mercy. And God listened. Jeremiah attests to this. In Lamentations 3:22-24 Jeremiah writes, “The faithful love of the LORD never ends! His mercies never cease. Great is his faithfulness; his mercies begin afresh each morning.” What an overwhelming truth. God’s faithful love NEVER ends and His mercies NEVER cease. I can’t even begin to get my brain around that. And the beauty is, every morning I wake up, God is there, with all His love and mercy waiting for me all over again! Today, when you need to, cry out to God. Pour out your complaints to Him. Tell Him all about your troubles. He has a brand new day’s worth of mercy and love waiting for you.

TODAY’S PRAYER
Father, I am so glad I can come before You and share all my burdens. I am so grateful for Your mercy and faithfulness. Thank You that they never cease but are new every morning. Praise You Lord.
AMEN    TODAY’S MEDITATION & VISUALIZATION
God’s mercy for me is new every morning
Visualize today’s verse. See yourself coming before Christ and pleading for His help. Sense His empathy toward you as you share your problems with Him. Imagine pouring out your complaints before Him at the same time sensing His deep compassion toward you. God’s mercy is real and you know it deep in your heart. Feel the praise build inside you and affirm, “God’s mercy for me is new every morning!”
LORD JESUS USE ME FOR YOUR WILL.
